**Welcome to the documentation of the Oceanograph platform. This guide has been written with the purpose of guiding you
through the
usage of the Oceanograph application.**

## Oceanograph Platform Principles

### Step 1: Testing
Test your water using your favourite testing method. Oceanograph is *not* a replacement
for manually testing your water using various electric, [lab](/glossary#lab-test)
or [titration testing](/glossary#titration-test) methods,
but rather provides you with a digital platform to store and analyse your test results. This is an
alternative to record your test results using other methods such as storing your values in a paper book or
electronics sheet.

### Step 2: Record your Test Results
Using the Oceanograph platform, insert your test results digitally. You can also register past
measurements. Some lab test results may be imported automatically. Follow [this link](/dashboard/new-measurement) to
learn how
to record your test results.

### Step 3: Analyse
The Oceanograph application will present you with charts and analytics data based on your test results.
The plaform may detect potential problems or future fluctuations based on the evolution of your test results.

### Step 4: Dose
Using the guidelines and analytics from the Oceanograph, you can confidently dose additional trace elements
accurately to your tank needs. Products that remove toxic elements can also be used
as the platform will warn you when it's time to reduce certain nutrients in your tank.
