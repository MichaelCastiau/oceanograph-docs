The basic chemistry of a reef tank is characterized by a delicate balance of various chemical compounds and ions that
are essential for the health and well-being of the organisms that inhabit the ecosystem. Some of the key chemical
parameters that are important in a reef tank include:

=== pH
The pH of a reef tank should typically be maintained within a range of 8.1 to 8.4, as many of the organisms living
within the tank are sensitive to changes in pH.
===

=== Alkalinity
[Alkalinity](/chemistry/alkalinity) is a measure of the buffering capacity of water and is
important for maintaining a stable pH range and supporting the growth and development of many organisms.
===

=== Calcium
[Calcium](/chemistry/calcium) is an important element that is required for the skeletal structures of many organisms, including
corals and crustaceans.
===

=== Magnesium
[Magnesium](/chemistry/magnesium) is important for regulating the levels of calcium and alkalinity in the water, as well as for
supporting the growth and development of many organisms.
===

=== Salinity 
Salinity refers to the concentration of dissolved salts in the water and is typically maintained within a
range of 34 to 36 parts per thousand (ppt) in reef tanks.
===

=== Nutrient levels
Excessive levels of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can promote the growth of undesirable
algae and other organisms in the tank and can harm or stress the organisms living within it.
===

Maintaining appropriate levels of these chemical parameters is essential for the health and success of a reef tank, and
regular monitoring and maintenance is necessary to ensure a stable and healthy ecosystem.
