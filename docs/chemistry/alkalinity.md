Alkalinity is a measure of the buffering capacity of water, or its ability to resist changes in pH. It is a critical
parameter in reef aquaria because many of the organisms that inhabit these environments rely on a stable pH range to
survive and thrive.

In the context of reef aquaria, alkalinity typically refers to the concentration of bicarbonate and carbonate ions in
the water. These ions act as buffers, helping to stabilize the pH of the water by neutralizing acids and bases that may
be introduced into the system. Alkalinity is usually measured in units of dKH (degrees of carbonate hardness) or ppm (
parts per million) of calcium carbonate.

Maintaining appropriate alkalinity levels in a reef tank is important for several reasons. Firstly, it helps to ensure a
stable pH range that is suitable for the organisms living in the tank. Secondly, it is important for the growth and
development of many organisms, including corals, which require a consistent supply of carbonate ions to build their
skeletal structures.

Alkalinity levels can be maintained through various means, including regular water testing and the addition of
alkalinity supplements as needed. It is important to avoid sudden or drastic changes in alkalinity, as this can stress
or harm the organisms living in the tank.
