Trace elements in a reef tank are chemical elements that are required in small amounts, but are essential for the health
and growth of coral and other invertebrates in the tank. These trace elements include:

- [Iron](/chemistry/iron) (Fe): Iron is a trace element that is necessary for the growth of zooxanthellae, the symbiotic algae that live
within the coral.

- Iodine (I): Iodine is important for the growth and coloration of corals, and it is also involved in the molting process
of crustaceans.

- [Strontium](/chemistry/strontium) (Sr): Strontium is required for the growth and skeletal formation of corals, and it also helps regulate pH and
alkalinity levels.

- Molybdenum (Mo): Molybdenum is essential for the growth and reproduction of some invertebrates, such as clams and
snails.

- Cobalt (Co): Cobalt is important for the production of vitamin B12, which is necessary for the health of many
invertebrates.

- Zinc (Zn): Zinc is required for the growth and health of some types of invertebrates, and it also plays a role in the
regulation of pH and alkalinity levels.

- Copper (Cu): Copper is important for the growth and reproduction of some invertebrates, but it can also be toxic at high
levels.

- Manganese (Mn): Manganese is necessary for the growth and development of some types of invertebrates, including corals.

These trace elements are typically added to the reef tank through specialized products or supplements, and they are
carefully monitored to maintain the proper balance of elements in the water.
