Carbon dosing, also known as carbon supplementation or carbon addition, is a technique used in reef tanks to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria and improve water quality. The main purpose of carbon dosing is to stimulate the growth of aerobic bacteria, particularly nitrate and phosphate-reducing bacteria, which help control nutrient levels in the aquarium.

In a reef tank, organic waste and excess nutrients like nitrates and phosphates can accumulate over time, leading to poor water quality and the growth of unwanted algae. Carbon dosing involves adding a carbon source, such as vodka, vinegar, or specialized liquid carbon products, to the aquarium water. The carbon source acts as a food source for the bacteria, encouraging their growth and metabolism.

When the bacteria consume the carbon source, they also consume oxygen, creating an oxygen-depleted environment. This encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria that thrive in low-oxygen conditions, such as nitrate and phosphate-reducing bacteria. These bacteria convert nitrates and phosphates into harmless nitrogen gas and orthophosphate, respectively, thereby reducing the nutrient levels in the water.

By reducing nitrate and phosphate levels, carbon dosing helps inhibit the growth of algae, as algae require these nutrients to thrive. Additionally, carbon dosing can improve the overall water quality, enhancing the health and vitality of coral and other sensitive reef inhabitants.

It's important to note that carbon dosing should be done with caution and careful monitoring. The process can have a significant impact on the aquarium's chemistry, and sudden changes in nutrient levels can affect the balance of the tank. Therefore, it is advisable to start with small doses of the carbon source and gradually increase them while monitoring the water parameters closely. Regular testing of water parameters such as nitrate, phosphate, and pH is essential to ensure a stable and healthy reef environment.
