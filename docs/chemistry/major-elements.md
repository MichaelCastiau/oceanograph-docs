- [Calcium](/chemistry/calcium) (Ca): Calcium is a vital element for the growth of coral and other invertebrates in the reef tank. It is often
added to the tank in the form of calcium carbonate or calcium chloride.

- [Magnesium](/chemistry/magnesium) (Mg): Magnesium is also important for the growth of coral, and it helps maintain the proper balance of calcium
and alkalinity in the water.

- [Alkalinity](/chemistry/alkalinity) (KH): Alkalinity refers to the water's ability to buffer against changes in pH. It is important for
maintaining the stability of the water chemistry in the reef tank.

- Nitrogen (N): Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for coral growth, and it is typically found in the form of nitrate (NO3)
and ammonium (NH4).

- Phosphorus (P): Phosphorus is also important for coral growth and is typically found in the form of phosphate (PO4).
