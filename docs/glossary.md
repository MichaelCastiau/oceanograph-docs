#### Lab Test
A lab test is a testing method involving sending water samples to a laboratory capable of measuring
the concentrations of several trace elements or ions present in the water samples. Lab test are 
known to be more accurate than home tests and have more capabilities to test certain elements. 
Typically, lab tests are more expensive than home testing and take more time. The Oceanograph team
recommends using a lab test once a month to test all trace elements in your salt and reverse osmosis water (if applicable).

#### Titration Test
A titration is a technique where a solution of known concentration is used to determine the 
concentration of an unknown solution. 
Typically, the titrant (the know solution) is added from a buret to a known quantity of the analyte 
(the unknown solution) until the reaction is complete.
Typically titration tests use a color chart to determine the concentration of the analyte.
