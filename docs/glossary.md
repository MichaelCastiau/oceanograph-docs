### Ecosystem

A reef tank ecosystem is a closed aquatic environment that is created to simulate the conditions of a natural coral
reef. The ecosystem is made up of a diverse range of living and non-living elements, including corals, fish,
invertebrates, rocks, sand, and water. These elements interact with one another in complex ways, creating a delicate
balance that is essential to the health and vitality of the ecosystem.

In a reef tank ecosystem, corals are the foundation of the ecosystem. They provide shelter, food, and a substrate for a
wide range of other organisms, including fish and invertebrates. Fish play an important role in the ecosystem as well,
serving as pollinators, herbivores, and predators. Invertebrates, such as shrimp, crabs, and snails, help to keep the
ecosystem clean by consuming detritus and other organic matter.

Non-living elements, such as rocks and sand, provide a substrate for corals to attach to and form the reef structure.
Water is also an essential element of the ecosystem, providing a habitat for the organisms, as well as the medium for
the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products.

Maintaining a healthy reef tank ecosystem requires careful management of a wide range of factors, including water
chemistry, temperature, lighting, and nutrient levels. It also requires careful attention to the needs of the individual
organisms within the ecosystem, as well as the interactions between them.

### Lab Test

A lab test is a testing method involving sending water samples to a laboratory capable of measuring
the concentrations of several trace elements or ions present in the water samples. Lab test are
known to be more accurate than home tests and have more capabilities to test certain elements.
Typically, lab tests are more expensive than home testing and take more time. The Oceanograph team
recommends using a lab test once a month to test all trace elements in your salt and reverse osmosis water (if
applicable).

### PPM

PPM stands for "parts per million". It is a unit of measurement used to express the concentration of a substance in a
solution. In the context of a reef tank, PPM is often used to express the concentration of various minerals and
nutrients, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, that are important for the growth and health of corals and other
marine organisms.

For example, if a nutrient has a concentration of 1 ppm in a solution, it means that there is one part of the nutrient
for every one million parts of the solution. This can also be expressed as a percentage by multiplying the PPM value by
0.0001.

### Sump

A sump is a separate container or chamber that is connected to a reef tank and is used to house and hide various pieces
of equipment that are necessary for the operation of the tank. The sump is typically located beneath the main tank, and
water is gravity-fed from the main tank into the sump, where it is filtered, heated, and returned back to the main tank.

In a reef tank, the sump serves several important functions. It provides additional water volume, which helps maintain
stable water chemistry and temperature. It also allows for the placement of equipment, such as protein skimmers,
heaters, and return pumps, which can be housed and hidden from view in the sump.

The sump also provides a space for additional filtration, such as mechanical filtration, chemical filtration, and
biological filtration. This can be achieved through the use of filter socks, filter media, and a refugium, which is a
separate chamber within the sump that is used to cultivate beneficial microorganisms and macroalgae.

### Titration Test

A titration is a technique where a solution of known concentration is used to determine the
concentration of an unknown solution.
Typically, the titrant (the know solution) is added from a buret to a known quantity of the analyte
(the unknown solution) until the reaction is complete.
Typically titration tests use a color chart to determine the concentration of the analyte.

### Trendline

In the context of tracking reef tank water parameters, a trendline is a visual representation of the data points
recorded over time. It is used to identify trends or patterns in the data, which can help reef tank owners to make
informed decisions about the care and maintenance of their tanks.

For example, if a reef tank owner is tracking the temperature of their tank over time, a trendline can help them to
identify if the temperature is increasing or decreasing over time, and at what rate. This information can be useful in
making adjustments to the tank's heating or cooling system, or in identifying potential problems with equipment that may
be affecting the temperature of the tank.

Trendlines can be plotted for a variety of water parameters, including temperature, salinity, pH, and nutrient levels.
By monitoring these parameters over time, and plotting them on a trendline, reef tank owners can gain a better
understanding of how their tanks are performing, and make adjustments as needed to ensure optimal tank health.

The Oceanograph platform provides users with the ability to plot trendlines for multiple water parameters, as well as
the ability to view and analyze historical data for each parameter. This information can be used to identify potential
problems or areas for improvement, and to make informed decisions about the care and maintenance of a reef tank.
