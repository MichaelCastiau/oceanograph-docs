The Analytics capabilities of Oceanograph are the main power of the platform. Potential issues,
scheduled tasks or needed maintenance are automatically detected by the platform to assist you
reaching perfect water quality for your tank inhabitants.

This however does not mean that you shouldn't follow advice from experienced aquarists or monitor your tank manually since not
all issues can be detected solely through water measurements. [Annotations](/analytics/annotations) also help
link events in your tank (such as the addition of livestock or dosing of products) to fluctuations of your water values.

The entry point of the analytics view is the  [analytics page](https://www.oceanograph.net/analytics) in the platform.
