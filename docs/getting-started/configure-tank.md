The Oceanograph platform is designed to provide you with an intuitive and flexible way to manage your reef tanks. When
you create an account on the platform, **a default reef tank is created automatically**, which can be configured and
customized to suit your needs.

> Visit [oceanograph.net/tanks](https://www.oceanograph.net/tanks) to view and manage your tanks.

Once your tank is set up, we will provide you with a range of tools and resources to help you manage your tank
effectively.

## Setup

On the [tanks](https://wwww.oceanograph.net/tanks) page, **choose a name and configure the total volume of the tank.** ([Sump](/glossary#sump) included).

All of the data entered in the platform, as well as any annotations or notes you add, are automatically linked to your
tank, providing a comprehensive record of your tank's history and health. This makes it easy for you to track changes
over time, identify trends, and make informed decisions about your tank's care and maintenance.

In addition to the default tank, the Oceanograph platform allows you to create multiple tanks. This can be useful if you
have multiple tanks or if you want to create separate tanks for different types of coral or fish.

A basic plan allows for a maximum of 2 tanks. Pro plans allow for a maximum of 5 tanks.

## Selecting the Tank

On the [dashboard](https://www.oceanograph.net/dashboard) page or any other page on the platform, the menu will present you with the tanks
you have configured and allow you to select the tank you wish to analyse. All data shown on the platform is linked to the actively selected tank
in the menu.
