The Oceanograph platform is an online tool designed for reefers to help them manage and optimize their reef tanks. The
platform offers two plans: basic and pro, each with specific features aimed at meeting the needs of reefers.

## Basic Plan

The basic plan of the Oceanograph platform is designed to provide a simple and accessible starting point for beginning
reefers. The platform's basic plan offers a user-friendly interface and a range of tools and resources that can help new
reefers quickly get started with managing and monitoring their reef tanks.

The plan includes features such as real-time monitoring of water parameters, data visualization and analysis tools, and
easy-to-use guides and tutorials that cover key aspects of reef tank maintenance and care.

## Pro Plan

The Pro Plan on the Oceanograph platform is designed to provide experienced reefers with advanced tools and resources
for analyzing a wide range of water parameters beyond the basic ones. The Pro Plan offers an array of additional
measurement options
that include elements such as strontium, barium, iodine, and others.

By using these measurements, experienced reefers can gain a deeper understanding of their tank's chemistry and fine-tune
their
water parameters to create the optimal environment for their coral and fish. Additionally, the Pro Plan provides access
to more advanced data visualization and analysis tools that enable users to identify trends, track changes over time,
and make informed decisions about their tank's health.

The Pro Plan can be a valuable tool for those who are looking to take their
reef tank management to the next level. It is aimed at experienced reefers who have a deeper understanding of their
tanks
and are looking for more advanced tools to help them achieve their goals.
