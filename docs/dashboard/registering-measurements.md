> digitally in the Oceanograph platform.

Your dashboard is the starting point to register new or past water test results. 
Test results are commonly also referred to as measurements. This step hence requires
you to already having tested your water using your favourite testing method.

On the [dashboard](https://www.oceanograph.net/dashboard) page, select the reef tank you wish to
add test results (commonly referred to as measurements) to in the menu.

Then, press the plus icon under 'New Measurement' to select which parameter you would like to record test results for.
You can add additional test results by pressing the plus icon again and selecting another parameter.
Optionally another date then the current date can be chosen for the measurement you are about to record.

Once you have entered your test results, press the 'Save Measurements' button. The platform will immediately
give you feedback as to whether these water values fall within an acceptable range for optimal health of your reef tank's
[ecosystem](/glossary#ecosystem).
