The dashboard [page](https://www.oceanograph.net/dashboard) in the Ocenaograph plaform
presents you with a quick overview of your latest recorded tank parameters. It may also present
you with potential issues that need to be resolved, or scheduled maintenance or dosing tasks that need to be fulfilled.

It is your starting point in the Oceanograph platform.

Your dashboard is also the place to add new test results (also referred to as measurements) to your tank.

## Parameters Summary

The dashboard will present you with an overview of your latest tank water value parameters.
The most important parameters to test for are:

- Ammonia
- Nitrite
- Nitrate
- Phosphate
- Calcium
- Magnesium
- Alkalinity
- Ph
- Salinity

> A Pro subscription plan will also provide you information about additional elements such as Strontium, Barium and
> Iodine amongst others. These parameters are equally important but less of a concern for a beginning reefer given
> you perform regular water changes.

Each of these parameters or elements are vital to sustaining life in your tank.
Failing to balance these elements to mimic the concentrations naturally occuring in the ocean greatly affects the health
of your tank
inhabitants. All of these elements are linked together and the fluctuation of one element
may affect another parameter. On the contrary, if the parameters listed hereabove are dosed in correct concentrations,
your
tank inhabitants will prosper in a healthy environment.
