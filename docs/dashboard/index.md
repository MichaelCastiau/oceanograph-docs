The dashboard [page](https://www.oceanograph.net/dashboard) in the Ocenaograph plaform
presents you with a quick overview of your latest recorded tank parameters. It may also present
you with potential issues that need to be resolved, or scheduled maintenance or dosing tasks that need to be fulfilled.

It is your starting point in the Oceanograph platform.

Your dashboard is also the place to add new test results (also referred to as measurements) to your tank.

## Parameters Summary

The dashboard will present you with an overview of your latest tank water value parameters.
The most important parameters to test for are:

- Ammonia
- Nitrite
- Nitrate
- Phosphate
- Calcium
- Magnesium
- Alkalinity
- Ph
- Salinity

> A Pro subscription plan will also provide you information about additional elements such as Strontium, Barium and
> Iodine amongst others. These parameters are equally important but less of a concern for a beginning reefer given
> you perform regular water changes.

Each of these parameters or elements are vital to sustaining life in your tank.
Failing to balance these elements to mimic the concentrations naturally occuring in the ocean greatly affects the health
of your tank
inhabitants. All of these elements are linked together and the fluctuation of one element
may affect another parameter. On the contrary, if the parameters listed hereabove are dosed in correct concentrations,
your
tank inhabitants will prosper in a healthy environment.

## Stability

Stability is crucial for the health and success of a reef tank. In a reef tank, a delicate balance of water chemistry
and biological processes must be maintained to ensure the well-being of the diverse range of organisms that inhabit the
ecosystem. Even slight fluctuations in parameters such as temperature, salinity, pH, and nutrient levels can have
harmful effects on the organisms living within the tank.

To promote stability in a reef tank, it is important to establish and maintain a consistent and balanced environment.
This can be achieved through regular monitoring of water parameters, maintaining proper filtration and circulation, and
avoiding sudden changes in the tank's environment. Additionally, maintaining a diverse and healthy population of
organisms within the tank can help to promote stability by supporting natural biological processes and reducing the risk
of overgrowth or imbalances.

In a reef tank, stable water values are more important than perfect ones because marine organisms, especially corals and
other invertebrates, are highly sensitive to fluctuations in water parameters. Sudden changes in parameters such as
temperature, pH, salinity, and nutrient levels can stress or even kill these delicate creatures.

**While it's essential to maintain appropriate levels of water parameters, attempting to achieve perfect values can
sometimes do more harm than good. For example, if you strive to maintain a perfect pH of 8.3, any deviation from that
value can cause stress to the organisms in the tank.**

On the other hand, if you aim to keep water parameters within a certain range, rather than exact values, you can allow
for some natural fluctuation without causing harm to the tank's inhabitants. Therefore, regular monitoring and
maintaining stable water parameters within an acceptable range are key to keeping a healthy and thriving reeftank.
